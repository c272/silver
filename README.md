# Silver
*A C++ 2D game engine, running on SDL2 and OpenGL.*

## Introduction
Welcome to the Silver game engine repository. The source for the engine is freely available here on GitHub and also over on GitLab, and runs on SDL2 and OpenGL. This means you need to have SDL added to your C++ project before using Silver.

To look into the two dependencies, you can go here:

[LibSDL 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/)

[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)


If you're looking for the full documentation, you can go to the Silver website at http://c272.github.io/silver.

## Installation
This section will be fleshed out soon, as the engine develops. For the latest changelogs and patches, check the website at http://c272.github.io/silver
