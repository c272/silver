# Introduction
As mentioned on the cover page, this project is a simple 3D class-based game engine, which can also be used at a low level, with many methods allowing raw access to OpenGL and SDL themselves.

To get started with your project, simply go to the GitHub page (*see top right corner*) and clone the project into a new folder, by using the following command, or the magnet link.

    git clone https://github.com/c272/silver.git

When this is done, follow through to the "Starter Examples" section, and set up a basic window and test card. If you wish to see more in depth documentation of all objects and methods in the current version of Silver, travel to the "Class Documentation" section.

As pure reference, here's the basic file structure you should follow when using the engine:

    project_folder
    |	silver32
    |	|	silver_core.h
    |	|	silver_core.cpp
    |	silver_core.h
    |	silver_core.cpp
    |	silver_inc.h
    ...
    |	main.cpp

Using this structure will make it much easier to import new Silver dependencies when updating to a newer version.

Thank you for using Silver.
